### steps:
-   Analyze the dataset + use a baseline (e.g., ZeroR) model + Try to visualize the dataset, build histograms of features or outputs, look at random samples and look for outliers
-   Apply at least 3 different machine learning methods to the given problem. The methods should
    be selected from the ones covered in the course. None of the methods are allowed to be deep
    learning. For each method, you should test the effect of the hyperparameters and try to find a
    set of hyperparameter values that work well for the problem.
-   apply all the concepts you learned in the course.
-   Report:
        - your findings in a clear and concise manner
        - comprehensive results analysis
        - high impact on the final grade

### Deliverables:
1. Project Report (PDF):
    -   The team number and a list of member names (alongside their section and bench numbers).
    -   The problem definition, motivation, and evaluation metrics, including links to the dataset and any references. (This part can be copied from the proposal).
    -   Your results (the dataset analysis results and the experimental results).
    -   A discussion of your experimental results (an in-depth analysis).
    -   conclusion.
2. The project source code
3. Presentation summarizing your work and analysis
